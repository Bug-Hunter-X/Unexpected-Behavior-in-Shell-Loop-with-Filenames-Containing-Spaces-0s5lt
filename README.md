This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in shell scripting that can occur when processing lists of files, particularly those with spaces in their names.  The `bug.sh` script shows the flawed loop that incorrectly handles spaces within filenames.  The corrected version, `bugSolution.sh`, shows how to properly process the list and avoid issues with filenames containing spaces.
